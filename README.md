-   Handy git branch scripts added
-   -   Allows for easy creation of new branch.
-   -   Changes (if any) can be committed, stashed and popped on new branch
        or stashed in current branch.
-   -   Source branches can be set for new branches so that we don't
        automatically bring current branch changes.
